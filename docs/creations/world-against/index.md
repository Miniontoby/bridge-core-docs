You did some horrible things in The End which caused you to be moved to an alternate world where everything is trying to kill you as well as the universe. You need to go to The End to free yourself and save the universe. The "New World' isn't what you'd expect since you messed up. You are weak and you need to gain strength.

Passive Mobs won't like you so be careful. Don't eat raw meat because you will get sick.
There are A LOT more to discover!!

You will have a book detailing more.
