Description: You crash land on an arid planet, you don't remember who you are or anything from your past life. Now it's time to decide who you want to be on this new hostile world! Keep moving across different biomes until you find the required parts to build your ticket out of here. You will be chased by mobs that either want you dead or want something from you and they won't stop until they get it. The surface is dangerous, stay in the sun too long and you will become extremely fatigued or get crushed by the endless meteorites that hit the planet surface everyday or choose to hide underground and face the endless hordes of bugs that want you dead. This add-on rewrites The Overworld and parts of The Nether and adds a whole new progression system into the game with a whole new ending! Will you survive long enough to make it to The End?
