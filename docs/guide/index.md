## Installation

bridge. can be used in a few ways across many platforms, due to its design as a **Progressive Web App**. The essentially means you can use bridge. on almost any device that has a modern browser, such as Chrome and Edge on desktop, or Chrome and Safari on Android and IOS.

We have a seperate [guide on how to install bridge. to your device](/guide/download/index), providing you are using a browser that supports doing so. You can alos use bridge. directly in your browser at https://editor.bridge-core.app/.

:::tip
Please note that the installation is not in the traditional sense of installing through an `exe` file, but bridge. will still behave like a native app and work offline.
