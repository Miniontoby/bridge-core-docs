# ðŸš€ Features

On this page we will go through some of the main features that bridge. has to offer.

## Quick Project Setup

:factory: With bridge., setting up a Minecraft Bedrock project is as easy as filling a few inputs!

-   Create **behavior packs, resource packs, skin packs and world templates** quickly.
-   bridge. will create all files necessary for your packs to show in Minecraft, and additional files including a [project config](/guide/misc/project-config), to allow for compatibility with other tools.
-   If you [link bridge. to your com.mojang folder](/guide/misc/com-mojang-syncing/), your projects will automatically sync to Minecraft.

:lock: bridge.'s project structure stores your projects outside of the com.mojang folder by default, where they are safer, easier to access and easier to collaborate with others on.

-   If you need to uninstall Minecraft, your projects will be safe and **will not** be deleted.
-   Our project structure can **easily be used with GitHub** to collaborate with other creators and version control your projects.
-   This project strucutre is also used by other tools, so your project will remain compatible with tools following this [standard](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/project-config-standard).

## File Previews

:play_or_pause_button: bridge. allows you to preview a variety of different files without having to load up Minecraft!

-   View any model in your project; textures and animations will automatically be found by bridge., for you to view.
-   Quickly see collision boxes of blocks and entities, and view entity seat positions to find the perfect positions.
-   Conveniently view particle effects.
-   File previews will rapidly update when you make changes in a related file.

:framed_picture: With entities, you are also able to generate **Asset Previews** which are useful to showcase an entity. Below you can see how this works.

## Advanced File Creation

:bricks: With [bridge. presets](/extensions/presets/), you can create complete features, such as entities, items and blocks, by filling a small form. Any feature of an Add-On can also be created as an individual file, with a scaffold of the file already there for you!

-   bridge. supports every file that Minecraft does so by using bridge. you will be able to utilize every Add-On feature.
-   The files that you can create are determined by the experimental toggles and target version that you have configured in your [project config](/guide/misc/project-config). This ensures you don't use features that you shouldn't be using.
