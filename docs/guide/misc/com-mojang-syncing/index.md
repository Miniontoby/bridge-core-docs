## Basics

By default, bridge. stores your projects outside of the `com.mojang` folder which means they won't show up in Minecraft. However, bridge. can compile your packs to the `com.mojang` folder, providing you have linked it to bridge.

:::warning
Before you proceed, ensure you own and have installed Minecraft Bedrock on your Windows device.
:::

## Setup

The `com.mojang` folder, on windows, desktop (currently only platform that supports this feature) is located at `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang`. 

:::tip
You can quickly access this by pressing `Windows Key + R` and pasting the following `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang`
:::

Once you have located this folder, all you need to do is drag it from the file explorer onto bridge. Then you should see the following choice prompt.

Simply press the "Output Folder" option to set this as Dash's compilation output directory. You packs will now automatically update in Minecraft's development folders when you make a change in bridge.
