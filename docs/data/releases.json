v2.4.0 - \"Glazed Terracotta\" finally makes it easier to edit models from a bridge. project with Blockbench. We have also made substantial improvements to our tree editor, the performance of ZIP file importers and we have again made Dash, our built-in compiler, faster.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this update marks the first release that is part of our new fixed schedule update strategy. Going forward, we intend to release a new minor update (v2.X.0) every month and up to two weekly patch updates right after a new minor update. We hope that this change produces less stress for us and can help you experience new features faster.\r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n\r\n### Blockbench Integration (#690)\r\nbridge. now natively integrates Blockbench. We use a [custom built fork of Blockbench](https://github.com/bridge-core/blockbench) that can communicate directly with bridge. to make the experience as smooth as possible. Opening a model opens all connected files automatically and file saving will just work and re-compile your changes automatically.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Blockbench within bridge.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33347616/201474469-0d40aa7f-150a-4c29-b425-32c37a433b26.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### iframe API (#690)\r\nWe have added several new capabilities to our iframe API to make the Blockbench integration possible. You can read more about this API [on our new docs](https://bridge-core.app/extensions/iframe-api/index.html).\r\n- Added new \"fs.readAsDataUrl\" trigger\r\n- Added \"packIndexer.find\" trigger\r\n- Added \"packIndexer.getFile\" trigger\r\n- Added \"tab.setIsUnsaved\" trigger\r\n- Added \"tab.setIsLoading\" trigger\r\n\r\n### More Efficient Importers (#702, #718)\r\nAll ZIP importers now use a streaming solution that is slightly faster and more memory efficient.\r\n\r\n### Tree Editor Documentation (#717)\r\nYou can now right click parts of your JSON to see documentation when it is available.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of new documentation view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33347616/201474518-94843fcd-4385-475f-87e3-974325b1b53d.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Tree Editor Location Bar (#724)\r\nYou can now use the tree editor's new location bar to navigate through large files.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of the new location bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33347616/201474572-f02eeefd-142b-4f6d-b42a-2afa84f8532a.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Dash v0.10.7 (a0e8950db3dadcbed33286e011f46f6e085b609e)\r\nThis update to Dash comes with another set of significant performance optimizations. We are seeing improvements on real projects of anywhere between 20%-50% faster full builds.\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n- Updated vanilla data to latest Minecraft Preview\r\n- Removed new execute command

closing sound player (#708)\r\n- bridge. now works properly when used offline (#697)\r\n- Removed stale data package (#719)\r\n- Added \"enterkeyhint\" to tree editor inputs (#719) \r\n- Fixed
