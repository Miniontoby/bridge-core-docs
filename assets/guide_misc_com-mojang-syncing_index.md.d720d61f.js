However, bridge. can compile your packs to the <code>com.mojang</code> folder, providing you have linked it to bridge.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>Before you proceed, ensure you own and have installed Minecraft Bedrock on your Windows device.</p></div><h2 id="setup" tabindex="-1">Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#setup" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The <code>com.mojang</code> folder, on windows, desktop (currently only platform that supports this feature) is located at <code>C:\\Users\\&lt;USER&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\games\\com.mojang</code>.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>You can quickly access this by pressing <code>Windows Key + R</code> and pasting the following <code>%localappdata%\\Packages\\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\games\\com.mojang</code></p></div><p>Once you have located this folder, all you need to do is drag it from the file explorer onto bridge. at any time.
