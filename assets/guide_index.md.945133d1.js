The essentially means you can use bridge. on almost any device that has a modern browser, such as Chrome and Edge on desktop, or Chrome and Safari on Android and IOS.</p><p>We have a seperate <a href="/guide/download/index">guide on how to install bridge. to your device</a>, providing you are using a browser that supports doing so. You can also use bridge. directly in your browser at <a href="https://editor.bridge-core.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://editor.bridge-core.app/</a>.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Please note that the installation is not in the traditional sense of installing through an <code>.exe</code> file, but bridge. will still behave like a native app and work offline once installed.</p></div><p>The rest of the setup process may differ depending on your browser you are using; read through the next steps and skip over them if they don&#39;t show for you.</p><ol><li><p><a href="/guide/misc/com-mojang-syncing/index">Link your <code>com.mojang</code> folder</a> to bridge. by dragging it over the editor, from your devices file explorer.</p></li><li><p>Select the editor type that you want to use, from either the <a href="#tree-editor"><strong>tree editor</strong></a> or the <a href="#text-editor"><strong>text editor</strong></a>. The text editor will feel familiar for users coming from VSCode, while the tree editor offers a simpler view into your files, ideal for beginners to JSON files.</p></li><li><p>Choose a bridge. folder. This is where bridge. will store your projects and other data, such as settings, that bridge. needs to work correctly. It should be an empty folder in somewhere accessible, such as <code>Documents</code>.</p></li></ol><h2 id="creating-a-project" tabindex="-1">Creating a project <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-project" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>To get started making addons with bridge. you need to create a project, but before creating a project, you should be aware of the different <a href="/guide/misc/project-types/index">project types</a> that bridge. supports. Here, we will go through creating a <a href="/guide/misc/project-types/index.html#local-project">Local Project</a>, as they are available on every browser and platform that bridge. supports.</p><p>Start by pressing the &quot;Create Local Project&quot; button.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="screenshot of bridge. after setup with no projects"></p><p>Then you will see the following project creation window:</p><p><img src="'+r+`" alt="screenshot of the project creation window"></p><p>In this menu, you should input the details of the project that you are creating. The various fields are explained below.</p><h3 id="\u{1F527}-pack-types" tabindex="-1">\u{1F527} Pack Types <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F527}-pack-types" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The packs that you add to your project will define the capabilities of your project. An Add-On generally consists of a behavior and resource packs, while full maps, or marketplace products may require behavior packs, resource packs, skin packs and world templates all together. Generally, behavior packs are server sided and resource packs are client side.</p><h3 id="\u{1F9EA}-experimental-gameplay" tabindex="-1">\u{1F9EA} Experimental Gameplay <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F9EA}-experimental-gameplay" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Experimental gameplay features are specific subsets of features that are locked behind a world toggle in game. bridge. mimics these toggles in the <a href="/guide/misc/project-config">project config</a>, in order to prevent you from using features that your project shouldn&#39;t be. For example, most marketplace products don&#39;t allow any experimental features, so having these disable in bridge. will stop you from using them in the project.</p><h3 id="\u{1F4C3}-individual-files" tabindex="-1">\u{1F4C3} Individual Files <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F4C3}-individual-files" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Upon creating your project, bridge. will always generate a <code>manifest.json</code> and <code>pack_icon.png</code> file in each pack. However, here you can configure additional files to be added to your project auomatically, that are single instance files (only one is needed in a project), for example, the <code>sounds.json</code> and <code>terrain_textures.json</code> files..</p><h3 id="\u{1F58A}\uFE0F-name" tabindex="-1">\u{1F58A}\uFE0F Name <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F58A}\uFE0F-name" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The name of your project, should be a short title to describe the project. It is used in bridge.&#39;s UI and Minecraft, to identify your pack.</p><h3 id="\u270F\uFE0F-description" tabindex="-1">\u270F\uFE0F Description <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u270F\uFE0F-description" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The description should be a more detailed explanation of the project. This input can be left blank and changed in the project config at a later time.</p><h3 id="\u{1F5BC}\uFE0F-icon" tabindex="-1">\u{1F5BC}\uFE0F Icon <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F5BC}\uFE0F-icon" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Optionally, you can add an icon to represent your project. This will be automatically set to bridge.&#39;s logo if you don&#39;t set one yourself.</p><h3 id="\u{1F477}-author" tabindex="-1">\u{1F477} Author <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F477}-author" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>This field is important for specifiying who is making the project. This will be added to the manifest&#39;s metadata and shown inside of bridge.</p><h3 id="\u{1F194}-namespace" tabindex="-1">\u{1F194} Namespace <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F194}-namespace" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The namespace is important, as it keeps the identifiers in your project unique. It should be short, in <code>snake_case</code> and be unique to your project. It also can not be one of the reserved <code>minecraft</code> or <code>minecon</code> namespaces. The namespace is the bit at the start of an identifier, for example the <code>minecraft:</code> bit in <code>minecraft:apple</code>.</p><h3 id="\u{1F3AF}-project-target-version" tabindex="-1">\u{1F3AF} Project Target Version <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u{1F3AF}-project-target-version" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>It is important that you set the project target version to whatever Minecraft version that you are developing for; this will stop you from using features that may not be in your version yet (introduced in a preview version), or stop you from using old features and syntax. You can update this in your project config, if for example, a major Minecraft update releases during development, or a new preview releases.</p><h3 id="\u2699\uFE0F-additional-toggles" tabindex="-1">\u2699\uFE0F Additional Toggles <a class="header-anchor" href="#\u2699\uFE0F-additional-toggles" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>There are a couple of miscellaneous toggles that you can enable or disable in your project.</p><ul><li>Whether to add the pack name and description directly to the manifest. If you do this, the pack name and description will not be translatable to other languages through lang files.</li><li>Whether the pack is designed for Bedrock Dedicated Servers. This is used do decide whether the <code>mojang-net</code> and <code>mojang-minecraft-server-admin</code> modules should be available in GameTest scripts.</li></ul><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>Do not forget to scroll down in the project creation window, as you may miss some inputs!</p></div><p>Once you&#39;ve done that, you can click <strong>Create</strong> and bridge. will set up your project for you.

The tree editor has an option for <strong>bridge. predictions</strong>. This is a feature that is enabled by default that makes the editing experience even simpler by reducing the number of inputs to 2 from 3 and using our editor data to guess whether the value you are adding should be an object or value.
