If you install extensions this way, you can access the extensions features in every project that you create.</p><p>A <strong>local</strong> extension is installed in the <code>.bridge/extensions</code> folder inside of the project that you have selected when installing the extension. The extension will only be available to use in project that you have installed it to.</p><p>To install an extension, navigate to bridge.&#39;s extension store. Here you will be presented with all publically available extensions; here you can filter by tags (type of extension) or search. Once you have found the extension that may be useful to you, simply press <strong>&quot;DOWNLOAD&quot;</strong> and choose your install method. On the extension&#39;s card in the store, you may see extra options, such as a <strong>share</strong> button which allows you copy a link to the extension to quickly share it with others, and an <strong>information</strong> button which will link you to more information about the extension.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>The extension store can be located by pressing the jigsaw icon in the app&#39;s sidebar.</p></div><h2 id="creating-extensions" tabindex="-1">Creating Extensions <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-extensions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Feel like there&#39;s something missing in your development flow that you want to add, or you want to help others by publishing an extension on the store?
